// 5. Explore about Segue and create a short note on its use.

//  Segue is used to define the flow of your app’s interface. A segue defines a transition between two view controllers in your app’s storyboard file. The starting point of a segue is the button, table row, or gesture recognizer that initiates the segue. The end point of a segue is the view controller you want to display. A segue always presents a new view controller, but you can also use an unwind segue to dismiss a view controller.



// 6. Explore diff between Xib's And ViewController and create a short note on its difference.

// "xib" stands for Xml Interface Builder. A storyboard is like a canvas where we put all our .xib files. You no longer have any .xibs, we just have View Controllers directly on our canvas. Storyboard is a new feature available since the release of Xcode 4.2. With Storyboards, all screens are stored in a single file.

// View controllers are the foundation of our app's internal structure. Every app has at least one view controller, and most apps have several. Each view controller manages a portion of your app's user interface as well as the interactions between that interface and the underlying data.
